# copyparty-config-editor
This is a HTML basededitor for config files for the fileserver copyparty (https://github.com/9001/copyparty) written by the LLM gemini. 


I'll probably add translations in the future and a quick manual. 

I'll not add a graphical way to edit the global settings, since copyparty has a ton of options. I see this editor as a way to quickly edit a existing config file and usually that means shares and users get edited.
